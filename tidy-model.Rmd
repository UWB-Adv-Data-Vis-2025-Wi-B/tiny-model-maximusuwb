## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?
In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

We can see in the data that there is 31 observations, 2 species, the temperature ranges from 17.20 ti 39,49 and the mean chirping rate is 72.89.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
